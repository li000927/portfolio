# Visual Ash Studio Portfolio

## Overview

This is my responsive portfolio website for **Visual Ash Studio**, showcasing my multidisciplinary design work including UX & UI design, photography, graphic design, video production, and more. The website was created using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5**, and custom responsive design techniques. The design reflects my creative personality and focus on user-centered aesthetics.

## üí° My Process

I began the process with wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes created in Figma, keeping mobile-first principles in mind. I mapped out a clear navigation system, chose consistent typography and color palettes, and carefully considered the layout flow between sections.

From there, I built the website section by section using HTML and Bootstrap 5. Custom styling was written in CSS to enhance visual consistency and apply effects such as card hover animation, frosted glass (`backdrop-filter`) effect, and responsive image scaling.

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Responsive Layouts**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring the site adapted well to different screen sizes, especially with alternating content-image layouts in the portfolio section.
- **Solution:** I used Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system with conditional column flex directions (`flex-column`, `flex-md-row`, etc.), combined with custom media queries for fine control.

### 2. **Mobile Navigation**
- **Challenge:** Making the navigation menu intuitive and space-efficient on smaller devices.
- **Solution:** I used Bootstrap‚Äôs off-canvas component initially but eventually opted for a dropdown-style collapse menu to match UX patterns more commonly expected on mobile.

### 3. **Visual Alignment and Positioning**
- **Challenge:** Positioning decorative icons relative to text without fixed positioning breaking responsiveness.
- **Solution:** I wrapped the icons within relatively positioned containers and used `absolute` positioning with `z-index`, adjusted via media queries to maintain layout fluidity.

## üìò What I Learned

- The value of **planning** and **designing** before coding: clear structure makes coding smoother.
- How to integrate **responsive images** using `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.
- Deepened my understanding of **Bootstrap 5 components and utilities**.
- Handling layout challenges using **flexbox and media queries**.
- How to work with **layered positioning** and decorative elements while keeping content accessible and responsive.
